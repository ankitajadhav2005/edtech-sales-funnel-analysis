# Lead Data Analysis Project

## Business Problem
The business generates leads from multiple acquisition channels but lacks clarity on:
- Which sources produce high-quality leads
- Where leads drop off in the funnel
- Why overall conversion rates are low

The goal of this project is to analyze lead data and provide actionable insights to improve enrollments.

---

## Dataset Overview
- Total leads analyzed: 360
- Data sourced from 5 relational tables
- Key fields: Lead ID, Lead Source, Lead Status, Lead Date

---

## Tools Used
- SQL: Data extraction, joins, aggregations, funnel metrics
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib): Data cleaning and EDA
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards and funnel visualization

---

## Analysis Performed
1. Data cleaning (duplicates, missing values, invalid entries)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (lead trends, source distribution)
3. Funnel analysis:
   Leads → Contacted → Qualified → Converted
4. Source-wise conversion analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Overall lead-to-enrollment conversion rate: 17.88%
- Highest drop-off occurs at the Lead stage
- Social media generates highest revenue but has moderate conversion
- Email marketing generates fewer leads but higher conversion rate
- Website leads perform worst despite moderate lead volume

---

## Business Recommendations
- Focus investment on high-conversion channels like Email Marketing
- Improve early-stage lead qualification and engagement
- Re-evaluate website lead capture strategy
- Standardize lead status tracking to improve data quality
