# EdTech Sales Funnel & Conversion Analysis

## Business Problem
An EdTech company wanted to understand why a large number of leads were not converting after demo interactions.

## Objective
To analyze the end-to-end sales funnel and identify major drop-off stages and operational gaps affecting conversion.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Total Leads
- Demo Scheduled & Attended
- Conversion Rate
- Funnel Drop-offs
- Post-demo follow-up outcomes

## Analysis Summary
- Only ~18% of total leads converted.
- Significant drop-off observed after demo attendance.
- Post-demo follow-up failures and affordability concerns were major reasons for non-conversion.
- Senior vs junior analysis was exploratory and highlighted process inconsistency rather than individual performance.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Python for EDA

## Recommendations
- Improve post-demo follow-up process.
- Address affordability concerns earlier in the funnel.
- Standardize demo and follow-up handling across sales teams.
